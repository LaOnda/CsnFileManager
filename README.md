CsnFileManager
==============
Zend Framework 2 Module

### What is CsnFileManager? ###
CsnCsnFileManager is a simple File Manager that lets users upload files. It makes it easy to download a file or include it in your html. The files are stored in a directory not directly accessible by *Apache*.

Installation
------------
1. Installation via composer is supported, simply run:
`php composer.phar require coolcsn/csn-file-manager:dev-master`

2. Copy the sample file-manager configuration from `./vendor/coolcsn/csn-file-manager/config/file-manager.local.php.dist` to `./config/autoload` renaming it to **file-manager.local.php**. Edit the file, replacing the directory path with one where you want to store the uploads.

3. Add 'CsnFileManager' to your application configuration in `config/application.config.php`. An example application configuration could look like the following:

```
'modules' => array(
    'Application',
	'CsnUser',
    'CsnFileManager',
)
```

**Note: ** You may need to enable the `php_fileinfo` extension depending on your *php* version.
